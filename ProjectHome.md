# <font color='blue'>Open Collaboration - Android Phone to AXIS 213 PTZ Camera</font> #

This application is a remote video viewer and PTZ camera control application written on the Android platform. More than one user can move a PTZ camera from his Android phone. The project focuses on establishing communication with camera, and development of user interface for the Android phone platform.  The communications must allow for multiple phones or Android emulators (running on laptops) to network with each other and the camera.  The communications also need to allow for the phone applications to leave or disconnect from the camera and other phones. This is a project for [CSE 537S - Mobile Computing](http://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/cse537/) at [Washington University in St. Louis](http://cse.wustl.edu) (Fall 2009).
